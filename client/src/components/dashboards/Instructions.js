                              are buying or selling produce or items, and if

                              When driving over a field, the farmer will be

                              hunger, and will receive prompts to feed them when

                              In an animal field, the farmer is able to take
                              produce such as milk or eggs from the animals, and
                              can also send the animals to slaughter

                              In a crop field, the farmer will be made aware
                              when the crops are mature enough to harvest, and
                              can collect them when ready

                              In a tech field, the farmer is able to see the
                              health of the gas generator or solar panel, and
                              can collect green gas or solar power, or recycle

                              the market modal, allowing the farmer to see

                              Fields come in a number of types: "Fallow" to
                              start with, then can be set to "Grazing",
                              "Arable", "LakeLand", "FishFarm", or "Tech"
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              The type of field can only be set when it is
                              empty, and is done so when a type of animal, plant
                              or tech is placed in that field
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              For example, if you place a cow in an empty field,
                              the field will be set to "Grazing" for "Cows"
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              The exception is the petting zoo type, which can
                              only be set once a type is already in place, at a
                              cost of Â£10000. For example, a "Grazing" field for
                              "Cows", can become a "Petting Zoo" for "Cows"
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              A petting zoo can also be changed back to the
                              previous field type, again at a cost of Â£10000
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              The colours of the fields will change dependent on
                              the type of field chosen and the type of animal,
                              plant or tech placed inside

                              There are ten different types of animal you can

                            <li>
                              These are cows, sheep, chickens, pigs, crocodiles,

                              Cows, sheep and llamas eat straw, so you will need
                              to keep straw in supply if you are farming these
                              animals

                              Chickens, ducks, geese and pigs eat corn, so you
                              will need to keep corn in supply if you are
                              farming these animals

                              crocodiles eat fish, so again you will need to
                              keep these in supply if farming these animals

                              animals whilst in your care, so will prompt you
                              when they need to be fed and rested from milking
